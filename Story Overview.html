        <p>The story revolves around the mysterious recipe of the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Mr. Krabs engage in a new round of battle. Although SpongeBob manages to thwart Plankton's fierce attacks, he still falls victim to his tricks. At a critical moment, the recipe mysteriously disappears, resulting in no one being able to make the Krabby Patty anymore. For the residents of Bikini Bottom, who are extremely dependent on the Krabby Patty, this news is like a thunderbolt. The peace of the town is shattered, and the underwater world is thrown into chaos and turmoil. After saving Plankton, SpongeBob is treated as a traitor by the others. In a time of crisis, SpongeBob, Patrick, Plankton, Mr. Krabs, Sandy Cheeks, and Squidward manage to travel through time and space, following the scent of the Krabby Patty to a crowded beach. There, they encounter the bearded pirate who used tricks to steal the secret recipe, and a battle for the Krabby Patty begins.</p>
