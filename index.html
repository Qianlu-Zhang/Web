        <h2>SpongeBob SquarePants</h2>
        <p>SpongeBob SquarePants is a character from the American animated series "SpongeBob SquarePants" and its spin-offs. He lives in a city called Bikini Bottom on the ocean floor in the Pacific Ocean and works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab. He is a yellow, rectangular sea sponge with a body resembling a cleaning sponge. He has two arms, each with four fingers. His usual outfit consists of brown shorts, a white shirt, and a red tie. His body can regenerate if damaged. Although he does eat normally, he can also survive by filtering seawater. He is physically weak, and what is commonly thought of as a dumbbell is actually a plush toy. However, as the series progresses, he seems to become stronger. Interestingly, when he spars with Sandy Cheeks in karate, his physical weakness is not apparent, and they seem evenly matched. His signature catchphrase is: “I’m ready!”</p>
